To send emails through re:question, be sure to set an environmental variable on your system. You can use our offical account by setting the variable to the following address, but with the dashes replaced with the password. If you don't yet have the password for that account yet, go bother Tanis. In the meantime, if you want to use our own account, be sure to ensure it is set up for SMTP!

SETX MAIL_URL smtp://computcofficial@gmail.com:---------@smtp.gmail.com:465/
